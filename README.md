# AWS-Cloud-Cost-Optimization-Identifying---Stale-Resources
In this project, we'll create a Lambda function that identifies EBS snapshots that are no longer associated with any active EC2 instance and deletes them to save on storage costs.

### **Description**
  The Lambda function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the same account ('self') and also retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped). For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume (if exists) is not associated with any active instance. If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.
# AWS CloudFront Service (AWS CDN service ) :-
AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It accelerates the delivery of your website, APIs, video content, or other web assets by caching them at edge locations around the world. This ensures that users can access your content with low latency and high transfer speeds, regardless of their geographic location. CloudFront is part of AWS's suite of cloud computing services, specifically falling under the category of networking and content delivery.


**Problems Sovled by it**


AWS CloudFront solves several problems related to content delivery and web performance:

**Latency Reduction**: By caching content at edge locations closer to end-users, CloudFront reduces the time it takes for users to access your content. This helps in delivering a faster and more responsive web experience.

**Scalability**: CloudFront automatically scales to handle varying levels of traffic and demand. It can accommodate sudden spikes in traffic without impacting the performance or availability of your website or application.

**Global Reach**: With a network of edge locations spread across the globe, CloudFront enables content to be delivered to users worldwide with minimal latency. This is particularly beneficial for serving international audiences and expanding the reach of your content.

**Security**: CloudFront integrates with other AWS services to provide security features such as DDoS protection, encryption, access control, and origin authentication. This helps in securing your content and protecting it from various online threats.

**Cost-Effectiveness**: By offloading the delivery of content to edge locations, CloudFront reduces the load on origin servers and helps in minimizing bandwidth costs. Additionally, its pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures that you only pay for the resources you use, making it cost-effective for both small and large-scale applications.

Overall, AWS CloudFront improves the performance, scalability, availability, and security of web applications and content delivery, making it an essential tool for modern web development and content distribution strategies.

**How a CDN Works:**

When a user visits a website, data from that website’s server has to travel across the internet to reach the user’s computer. If the user is located far from that server, it can take a long time to load large files, such as videos or website images.
CDNs address this issue by storing website content on servers geographically closer to the users. These CDN servers act as intermediaries between the client (user’s computer) and the website server.

**Here’s how it works:
Caching**: CDNs cache (store) copies of website content (such as images, videos, scripts) on their servers. When a user requests a specific resource, the CDN delivers it from the nearest server instead of fetching it from the original website server.

**Dynamic Acceleration:**
CDNs optimize content delivery by dynamically adjusting the route and using faster connections. They choose the best server based on proximity, network conditions, and server load.

**Edge Logic Computations:**
CDNs can execute logic at the edge (near the user) to customize responses. For example, they can compress images, minify scripts, or even serve personalized content.

By distributing content across multiple locations, CDNs reduce latency, improve load times, and enhance the user experience.

**Why CDNs Are Important:**

   **Reducing Latency:** CDNs minimize the delay caused by the internet’s global and complex nature. They bring content closer to users, reducing the time it takes to load webpages.

**Efficiency:** CDNs decrease web traffic to the origin server, reducing bandwidth consumption and hosting costs for website owners.
Content Availability: CDNs handle high web traffic and prevent website crashes. Even if some CDN servers go offline, others take over to ensure uninterrupted service.

**Security:** CDNs can mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by absorbing fake traffic before it reaches the origin server1.

## Interview questions based on it :-
 
**What is AWS CloudFront, and what purpose does it serve?**

**Answer:** AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Its main purpose is to deliver content, such as web pages, videos, applications, and APIs, to users with low latency and high transfer speeds by caching content at edge locations close to end-users.


**How does CloudFront work? Describe its architecture.**

**Answer:** CloudFront works by caching copies of your content at multiple edge locations worldwide. When a user requests content, CloudFront routes the request to the nearest edge location that can serve the content, reducing latency and improving performance. If the content is not already cached at that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from the origin server (such as an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance) and caches it for future requests.


**What are the benefits of using AWS CloudFront?**

**Answer:** The benefits of using AWS CloudFront include improved website performance, reduced latency, global content delivery, scalability to handle high traffic volumes, DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and cost-effectiveness by offloading traffic from origin servers.


**Explain the concept of edge locations in CloudFront. How do they contribute to performance improvement?**

**Answer:** Edge locations are AWS data centers located in various geographic locations worldwide. They serve as caching endpoints for CloudFront, allowing content to be cached closer to end-users. This proximity reduces the latency of content delivery, resulting in faster load times and improved performance for users accessing the content.


**What is the difference between origin servers and edge locations in CloudFront?**

**Answer:** Origin servers are the source of the original content, such as an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, or an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). Edge locations, on the other hand, are the caching endpoints of CloudFront spread across the globe. Edge locations cache content from origin servers and serve it to end-users, reducing latency and improving performance.


**How does CloudFront cache content, and what caching options are available?**

**Answer:** CloudFront caches content based on the cache control headers set by the origin server or the caching behavior specified in the CloudFront distribution settings.

Field-level encryption for protecting sensitive data in transit.
AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration for protecting against common web exploits.


**Explain the process of invalidating objects in CloudFront cache.**

**Answer:** Invalidating objects in CloudFront cache allows you to remove outdated or incorrect content from edge locations before it expires. You can invalidate objects using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs by specifying the path or paths of the objects to invalidate. CloudFront then forwards the invalidation request to all edge locations, ensuring that subsequent requests for the invalidated objects fetch the latest content from the origin server.


**What is the role of signed URLs and signed cookies in CloudFront?**

**Answer** Signed URLs and signed cookies are security mechanisms used to control access to private content served by CloudFront. Signed URLs contain a signature that authenticates the user and grants access to specific resources for a limited time. Signed cookies work similarly but store the authentication information in an HTTP cookie. These mechanisms are commonly used to deliver secure, time-limited access to content without exposing sensitive information in the URL.


**How does CloudFront integrate with other AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda?**

**Answer** CloudFront integrates seamlessly with various AWS services:
With Amazon S3, CloudFront can serve static content directly from S3 buckets, improving performance and reducing latency.

### What is Container here ?

Imagine you're developing an application, let's say a website, and you want to deploy it to a server so that users can access it over the internet. Traditionally, you might install all the necessary software components (such as the web server, database server, and application code) directly onto the server's operating system.

However, managing software dependencies and configurations on a server can be complex and prone to errors. Additionally, it can be challenging to ensure consistency across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

**This is where containers come in. A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers isolate applications from each other and from the underlying host system, ensuring that they run consistently across different environments.
Think of containers as virtualized environments for running applications. They provide a consistent and predictable runtime environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure or operating system.**

Now, let's talk about the problem that AWS ECR solves. When you're using containers to deploy applications, you need a way to store and manage the container images. Container images are like snapshots of your application's filesystem at a specific point in time. They contain all the necessary files and configurations to run your application within a container.

AWS ECR solves the problem of managing container images by providing a secure and scalable registry service. Instead of managing container images on your own infrastructure, you can use ECR to store, manage, and deploy container images within your AWS account.

**Here's how AWS ECR helps:**

**Centralized Image Repository:** ECR provides a centralized location to store all your container images, making it easy to organize and manage your application artifacts.

**Security and Access Control:** ECR offers robust security features, such as encryption at rest and in transit, IAM integration, and VPC endpoint support, ensuring that your container images are secure and accessible only to authorized users.

**Scalability and Reliability:** ECR is a fully managed service that automatically scales to accommodate your image storage requirements and provides redundant infrastructure to ensure high availability and reliability.

**Integration with AWS Services:** ECR seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, such as ECS, EKS, Fargate, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline, enabling you to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications more efficiently.

Overall, AWS ECR simplifies the process of managing container images, providing developers with a secure, scalable, and reliable solution for storing and deploying containerized applications in the AWS cloud environment.


### What is Image here ?

Imagine you're creating a document for a school project. The document contains text, images, and formatting, and it's stored on your computer's hard drive. Now, think of this document as your application, and the computer's hard drive as the server where your application will run.

**An "image" in the context of containers is like a snapshot or a template of your application. It's a file that contains all the necessary ingredients for your application to work, just like your document contains text, images, and formatting.**

**Here's a simple breakdown of what an image contains:**

**Code and Dependencies:** Just like your document contains text and images, an image contains the code and files needed to run your application. This could be your website's HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, or any other code your application uses.

**Runtime Environment:** Your application needs a specific environment to run properly. An image includes everything needed to create that environment, such as the version of the programming language (like Python or Node.js) your application uses, libraries, and other tools.

**Configuration Settings:** Your application might have specific settings or configurations, like database connection strings or environment variables. These settings are also included in the image.

So, to sum it up, an image is like a package that contains everything your application needs to run: code, dependencies, and configuration settings. And just like you can create multiple copies of your document, you can create multiple copies of your image to run your application in different places, like on your computer for testing or on a server for the world to access over the internet.

AWS ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry) helps you store and manage these images, making it easier to deploy and run your applications in a consistent and reliable way. It's like having a safe and organized place to store all your document templates so you can access them whenever you need to create a new document.

# AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) :- 

The rise of containerization technologies like Docker, which simplified the packaging and distribution of applications but introduced complexities in orchestration and management. In summary, the lack of automation, scalability, fault tolerance, and security features in the early days of containerization made it difficult to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. COEs like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, ECS(elastice container servcie) and Apache Mesos emerged to address these challenges by providing automation, orchestration, and management capabilities that simplify the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications in modern cloud-native environments.

**Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) are both container orchestration services provided by AWS, but they differ in their underlying technology and approach to container management:**

**Technology:**

**ECS:** ECS is a proprietary container orchestration service developed by AWS. It is designed to simplify the deployment and management of Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. ECS uses its own container orchestration engine, which is tightly integrated with other AWS services.


**EKS:** EKS, on the other hand, is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google. EKS allows you to run Kubernetes clusters on AWS infrastructure, leveraging the features and capabilities of Kubernetes for container management.


**Abstraction Level:**

**ECS:** ECS abstracts away much of the complexity of managing container infrastructure, providing a simplified and opinionated approach to container orchestration. It integrates closely with other AWS services such as IAM, CloudWatch, and VPC networking.


**EKS:** EKS provides a more flexible and standardized approach to container orchestration, leveraging the widely adopted Kubernetes platform. It allows you to take advantage of Kubernetes' rich ecosystem of tools and resources, including community-contributed plugins, extensions, and best practices.


**Ease of Use:**

**ECS:** ECS is often considered easier to get started with, especially for users who are already familiar with AWS services and infrastructure. It offers a simplified user interface and a straightforward setup process.


**EKS:** EKS may have a steeper learning curve initially, particularly for users who are new to Kubernetes. However, it provides greater flexibility and extensibility, allowing you to take advantage of the full power of Kubernetes for container management.


**Feature Set:**

**ECS:** ECS offers a comprehensive set of features for container orchestration, including task definitions, service definitions, auto scaling, and integration with other AWS services. It is well-suited for users who prefer a fully managed and integrated solution.


**EKS:** EKS provides all the features and capabilities of Kubernetes, including declarative configuration, service discovery, load balancing, rolling updates, and more. It is ideal for users who require a high degree of customization and control over their container environment.


In summary, the choice between ECS and EKS depends on factors such as familiarity with AWS services, preference for managed vs. self-managed solutions, and specific requirements for container orchestration and management. ECS offers simplicity and integration with AWS services, while EKS provides flexibility and compatibility with the Kubernetes ecosystem.


Kubernetes is an open source coantiner orchestration environment. On top of it maany comapny have made their own distribution like AKS(Azure kubernetes service), GKE(google kubernetes engine), EKS( elastic kubernetes service), openshift, etc.


**Architecture:**


**ECS Cluster:** The foundation of ECS architecture. It's a logical grouping of container instances (EC2 instances or Fargate tasks) that you manage.

**Container Instances:** These are EC2 instances or AWS Fargate tasks that host your containers. ECS can launch and manage containers on these instances.

**Task Definition:** Defines parameters for your application, including which Docker images to use, CPU and memory requirements, networking configuration, etc.

**Service:** Defines how many instances of a task definition should run and maintain in an ECS cluster. It ensures that the desired number of tasks are running and handles scaling, rolling updates, etc.

**Container Registry (e.g., Amazon ECR):** Stores your Docker images, making them accessible to ECS.

**How it Works:**


**Create a Cluster:** Start by creating an ECS cluster. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK.

**Define Task Definitions:** Write task definitions specifying the containers, their configurations, networking, and storage requirements.

**Create a Service:** Define a service within your cluster based on your task definition. The service will maintain a specified number of instances of your task definition, handle scaling, and manage updates.

**Containerize Your Application:** Dockerize your application if it's not already containerized. This involves creating a Dockerfile and building a Docker image.

**Store Docker Image:** Store your Docker image in a container registry, such as Amazon ECR. Make sure your ECS cluster has permissions to access this registry.

**Run Tasks:** Launch tasks or services based on your task definitions within your ECS cluster. ECS will schedule these tasks on available container instances.

**Monitor and Manage:** Monitor the performance of your containers, manage scaling policies, and handle any necessary updates or maintenance tasks.

**Integrate with Other AWS Services:** ECS integrates with other AWS services like ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) for distributing incoming traffic, CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, IAM for security, and more.


# AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Srvice) :-

AWS EKS is a managed kubernetes service prvided by AWS. It allows you to rin kubernetes (k8s) clusters opn AWS infrastrucure without needing to install, operate, or maintin your own kubernetes control plane.

Before starting EKS, its important to learn Kubernetes (k8s), which is an open source conatianer orchestration software or environment. 

So lets start with Kubernetes :-

# Kubernetes (K8s):-

We use servers to deploy applications. Earlier for each application or for each layer of application we use seperate servers so that they work properly and work accordingly but it was using a lot of resourecs and even we were never able to utilize the resources properly. 

Simply putting, it was wasting of resorces and money. That's why engineers built concepts of VMS (virtual machines) where with the help of some software like hypervisor etc we can convert a single servers into multiple virtual machine having their own OS, CPU and storage. 

Here the problem was their since each VM have their own OS then it was taking a lot of booting time to start the application also they were using a lot of resoures and here also as each vm have their own OS, CPU and Sotrage that's why it was not utilizing the resources properly and wastage of resources was their.

To overcome this issue, engineers come up with the concept of container. 

**A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit of software that encapsulates an application, its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files needed to run, into a single package. Containers are designed to run consistently across different environments, from development to production, without requiring changes to the underlying infrastructure or system configuration.**



**The major differences between Virtual Machines (VMs) and containers lie in their architecture, isolation level, resource utilization, and deployment model:**

**Architecture:**

**VMs:** Each VM runs its own complete operating system (OS) instance on top of a hypervisor, which abstracts and manages the physical hardware.
**Containers:** Containers share the host OS kernel and run isolated user-space instances, each containing the application code, dependencies, and libraries needed to run.
Isolation:

**VMs:** VMs provide strong isolation, with each VM having its own kernel, filesystem, and network stack, making them more secure but heavier in terms of resource consumption.
**Containers:** Containers offer lightweight isolation, sharing the host OS kernel, which makes them more efficient in terms of resource utilization but potentially less secure if not properly configured.
Resource Utilization:

**VMs:** VMs allocate fixed resources (CPU, memory, storage) to each virtual machine, often leading to resource inefficiency as resources allocated to VMs may remain unused.
**Containers:** Containers consume fewer resources compared to VMs because they share the host OS kernel and only include the application code and dependencies needed to run, resulting in better resource utilization.
Deployment Model:

**VMs:** VMs are typically deployed as self-contained images, including the OS, application code, and dependencies. They are more portable than traditional physical servers but less portable than containers.
**Containers:** Containers package the application code and its dependencies into a single deployable unit, making them highly portable across different environments, from development to production.
Performance:

**VMs:** VMs introduce some overhead due to the duplication of OS and other system-level components for each VM. This overhead can affect performance, especially in scenarios where many VMs are running on the same host.
**Containers:** Containers have lower overhead compared to VMs because they share the host OS kernel, resulting in faster startup times and better performance, especially for lightweight and short-lived workloads.
